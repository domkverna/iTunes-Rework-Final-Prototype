# iTunes-Rework-Final-Prototype
This was a project done for CSC-310: Human-Computer Interaction

This is a rework of iTunes and is not fully implemented. The changes add more color, easier to see icons, and other tools for the users to use.

Windows is required and this was created in Visual Studio through the WPF app designer.
